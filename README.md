openepg
=======

Open Source EPG generator for DVB Multiplexers

openepg is a lightweight [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) program built around [cherryepg](http://epg.cherryhill.eu/), a perl library for generating a MPEG-TS stream with EIT (Event Information Table) data, ment to be run on a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/).
It depends on [node-perl](https://github.com/tokuhirom/node-perl) to be able to use the library.
UI was built using tutorial from [Krol(){tech}](http://kroltech.com/2013/12/boilerplate-web-app-using-backbone-js-expressjs-node-js-mongodb/)

##Dependencies
###Perl (on Debian Wheezy)
```shell
sudo apt-get install perl libperl-dev
```
###Perl (on Raspbian)
```shell
sudo apt-get install perl libdbi-perl
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libperl.so.5.14 /usr/lib/libperl.so
```
###Node.js (on Debian Wheezy)
```shell
sudo apt install nodejs npm -y
```
###Node.js (on Raspbian)
```shell
wget http://node-arm.herokuapp.com/node_latest_armhf.deb
sudo dpkg -i node_latest_armhf.deb
```
##Install
###Download
```shell
git clone https://github.com/avcsa/openepg.git
```
###Install (Production)
```shell
cd openepg
make install
```
###Install (Development)
```shell
cd openepg
make install-dev
```
##Run
openepg consist on 5 modules:
* Status server (serves status info from and to all modules, it always must be run first)
* Gui server (serves the HTTP server for the GUI)
* Importer server (handles the importation of EIT data from a provider)
* EIT updater server (updates current EIT data to be sent to the multiplexer)
* Carousel server (sends current EIT data to the multiplexer)

You can run all modules together or one by one (last recommended)

###Together (Production)
```shell
make serve
```
###Together (Development)
```shell
make serve-dev
```
###Status server (Production & Development)
```shell
make serve_status
```
###Importer server (Production & Development)
```shell
make serve_importer
```
###EIT Updater server (Production & Development)
```shell
make serve_eitupdater
```
###Carousel server (Production & Development)
```shell
make serve_carousel
```
###GUI server (Production)
```shell
make serve_gui
```
###GUI server (Development)
```shell
make build-dev
make serve_gui
```
##Monit
Inside the 'monit' folder you will find a series of bash scripts along with a monitrc file to use with [Monit](http://mmonit.com/monit/).  Take them as examples and modify to suit your enviroment.  
For making monit run at startup and start OpenEPG and shut it down on system shutdown, you cand add this lines to /etc/inittab (modify to suit your enviroment):
```shell
mo:2345:respawn:su - pi -c '/usr/bin/monit -Ic /home/pi/openepg/monit/monitrc'
mon:2345:wait:su - pi -c '/usr/bin/monit -Ic /home/pi/openepg/monit/monitrc start all'
moff:06:wait:su - pi -c '/usr/bin/monit -Ic /home/pi/openepg/monit/monitrc stop all'
```
##Configuration
All configuration options are inside conf.json file.
##Importer
You will see there is a ftp importer and a reportv dataprovider. Most probably you will have another data provider, so take a look at these files and make your own implementation.  Both (importer and data provider) can be configured in conf.json
##TODO
* Replace cherryepg with a pure js implementation
* Allow config to be changed from the gui
* Hot reload of config on changes
* Move to a pure [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) data implementation, with push and pagination
* Write an autoupdate to be controlled from the GUI for automated download and install of new versions

Please let me know how does it go to you on github issues!
